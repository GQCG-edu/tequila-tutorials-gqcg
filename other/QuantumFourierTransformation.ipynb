    "In various quantum algorithms the quantum Fourier transformation (QFT) is used to switch from the computational basis to the Fourier basis. If you learned about the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm you know the algorithm uses the inverse QFT. The QFT is one of the most important building blocks for various quantum computing algorithms, and in this notebook we will explain everything you need to learn about the QFT. Learning the inverse QFT is trival once we have finished discussing the QFT.  \n",
