    "In order to use madness as chemistry backend in tequila we need a slightly altered version.  \n",
    "We can conveniently install it over the anaconda cloud with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install madtequila -c kottmann\n",
    "```\n",
    "alternatively we can compile it manually: follow the instructions from this [fork](https://github.com/kottmanj/madness).  \n",
    "Madness is quite sensitive about changes in it's dependencies (e.g. MKL or MPICH), so we recommend to install this in a fresh environment without many other packages. See the last cell of this notebook for an example."

    "In the previous cell we created an Helium atom in a system adapted orbital basis. Note that we did not specify how many orbitals shall be computed. The default for this is: N-Orbitals = N-electrons. Helium has 2 electrons, so 2 orbitals were computed. The printed information shows us, that we have one Hartree-Fock orbital with occupation number 2.0 and one pair-natural orbital (PNO) with occupation number 0.004. These occupation numbers are from the surrogate model (MP2-PNO) which is based on perturbation theory. From the 0.004 occupation number in the PNO we see that the perturbation in the surrogate is not large meaning that it is justified. We can therefore expect, that these two orbitals are close to optimal."
