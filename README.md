# tequila-tutorials
This repository functions as a tutorial collection for tequila.  
Feel free to contribute your own! (see below)  

It's recommended to start with [BasicUsage](BasicUsage.ipynb) and take a look at [FAQ](FAQ.ipynb).


[You can also get a first overview from this presentation](/docs/tequila.pdf)  
or the [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUdf0P2fW2E) of it  
or checkout our [overview article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03057).  

Feel free to contact us on github or via [email](mailto:jakob.kottmann@utoronto.ca) if you have any questions/remarks/suggestions/troubles!

Note that some tutorials currently require you to check out the `devel` branch of tequila's main repository, since the features are not merged into the main branch yet. Those tutorials currently are: PyZXwithTequila.ipynb, Tensorflow_Interface.ipynb OpenQASMConversions.ipynb AdaptiveSolver.ipynb.
