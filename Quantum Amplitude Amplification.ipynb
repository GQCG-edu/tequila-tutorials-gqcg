    "The Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA) algorithm is one of the most important applications in quantum computing. The QAA algorithm objective is to increase (we refer to amplify) the probability of measuring the desired output (we call the good states) in a quantum system. The QAA algorithm can be used as a searching algorithm which achieves the well-known square-root speed-up compared to its classical counterpart. The QAA algorithm is also implemented in various other algorithms in quantum computing.\n",
